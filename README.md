# ChristmasDiorama
A sketch to control a DFRobot mp3 player to play Christmas carols and to control the street/house lights etc.

At the moment, I'm reckoning to use an ESP12F set up with a low power voltage regulator so that it can:

* use the Internet to check date and time;
* go into deep sleep overnight;
* have active times in the day;
* stay on all day on Christmas Day;
* respond to "lights on/off" events (via an LDR);
* do anything else I think of while developing the project.
